## How to Use This Documentation

### For Development with Claude
These markdown files are structured to help Claude (or any AI assistant) understand the full context of your project:

1. **Start with PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md** to understand the big picture
2. **Review SITEMAP.md** for website structure
3. **Check DESIGN-REQUIREMENTS.md** for visual guidelines
4. **Use CONTENT-CHECKLIST.md** to track content needs
5. **Reference TECHNICAL-SPECS.md** for implementation details

### When Working on Specific Tasks
Simply tell Claude which aspect you're working on, and reference the relevant markdown file. For example:
- "Let's work on the homepage design based on DESIGN-REQUIREMENTS.md"
- "Help me create the contact form using the specs in TECHNICAL-SPECS.md"
- "Write content for the CFO service page using old-website-content.md"
